# Notes for the project

branches in the project are like this:

bug-free is the production branch. should be the latest
day.

buggy is the pre-production branch. has latest updates
 but should regularly still build.

disaster is my working branch. Probably doesn't build.
That's okay since it will build before it's squashed into buggy!
